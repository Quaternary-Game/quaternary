## Development Software

There are a couple of software tools that are commonly used for this project. The tool, and its purpose, are listed
below.

### Godot Engine

[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is used for game development. The all-in-one solution provides a common 
space for everyone to work on the project. Along with Godot, GDScript is the programming language of choice.

Currently, Godot Engine version 4.1 is being used. It is recommended to install Godot Engine through the Steam store.
If Godot is installed through Steam, it is recommended to "pin" the version to 4.1 through the 
`properties -> betas -> "4.1"` setting.

### Image Creation

Currently, three different tools are being investigated for image creation.

1. [Krita](https://krita.org/en/)

    - Fully free and open source.
    - Supports raster images (PNG/JPG).

2. [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)

    - Source-Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite) for free compilation.
    - For distribution convenience, it can be purchased for $20 on
        [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431730/Aseprite/)
    - Specialized in pixel art with refined tooling.

3. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

    - Fully free and open source.
    - Good for SVGs, but the most difficult to use.

## Style Guide

This style guide will be expanded further when more development-oriented work begins on the project. The current
standards are listed below.

### Code Style

1. Within GDScript, the optional static typing should be used at all times.
2. Variable names should be descriptive.
3. ... More to come soon.
